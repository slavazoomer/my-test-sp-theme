That’s why we’re delighted to partner with EARTHDAY.ORG for the fourth consecutive year to support our planet and partner with their Protect Our Species campaign aimed at helping the pollinators who keep our ecosystems thriving – including the charming ladybug! <\/p><p>Did you know that 90% of flowering plants and 35% of the world’s food crops depend on pollinators like the lady bug? Pollinators are lost each year to many complicated causes, including habitat loss, climate change, pesticide use and pollution. Ladybugs in particular are increasingly threatened with extinction due to losses in habitat and alterations in climate conditions. Without pollinators like the ladybug, our fragrances wouldn’t be possible and the global food supply would be dangerously affected.

Ladybugs lay hundreds of eggs in the colonies of aphids and other plant-eating pests. When they hatch, the ladybug larvae immediately begin to feed. In this way, ladybugs can control insect pests through natural predation.<strong><br\/><br\/>•   Why are Ladybug populations dwindling?<br\/><\/strong>Like most animals, the primary threat to ladybugs is the destruction of their habitat. Ladybugs are endangered because their habitats are declining due to human intervention, pollution, invasive species, and climate change. Human development has taken an overwhelming toll on the environment. Impact from land use practices such as deforestation continues to deteriorate and fragment remaining pockets of habitat and accelerate biodiversity loss. Pesticides and other forms of pollution are also of severe concern.<\/p><p><strong><br\/>•   Why does biodiversity matter?<br\/><\/strong>Although there are over 5,000 species of ladybugs around the globe - about 500 native to North America - the extinction of even one single species can be a devastating loss. Ecosystems with more diversity have more players who can contribute when conditions unexpectedly change, such as short summers or a year without much food. Not all ladybugs will succeed in eating aphids under all conditions and in all places. This means that the fewer the species of ladybugs, the more vulnerable ecosystems become to pest insect populations. <\/p>","text_size":"typeset","secondary_color":false}}},"block_order":["subheading_L3QtqT","template--15279552364586__917d1b06-62e9-42ac-ae0b-fce6038be960-heading-1","template--15279552364586__917d1b06-62e9-42ac-ae0b-fce6038be960-text-1"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/ladybug.webp","image_position":"center center","layout":"text_first","text_box_position":"middle","text_alignment":"left","image_ratio":"650px","enlarge_content":false,"full_width":true,"show_divider":false,"mobile_layout":"image_first","mobile_text_alignment":"left","mobile_image_ratio":"auto","use_custom_colors":true,"colors_button_label":"#ffffff","colors_button_background":"#1a1b18","colors_text":"#212326","colors_background":"#f1ebed","gradient_background":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":24}},"featured_product_3maC7a":{"type":"featured-product","blocks":{"title_qCm4Rd":{"type":"title","settings":{"title_size":"h2","title_tag":"h2","show_price":false,"price_size":"medium"}},"rating_XdYQbP":{"type":"rating","settings":{}},"countdown_qHpQHp":{"type":"countdown","settings":{"heading":"Hurry up !
